# NahidaKV
NahidaKV is a high-performance key-value storage engine. Based on the content of RocksDB and WiscKey paper, NahidaKV performs cross-level write, key-value separation, batch processing and other operations to optimize the read and write amplification problems. It applies to scenarios such as high-concurrency write, high-performance reliable single data source, and log storage.

The project is under continuous development, and will support transaction processing, hotspot processing and other operations in the future, and further optimize the previous historical problems.

The name is taken from Genshin Impact tributing to Dendro Archon, Nahida.
